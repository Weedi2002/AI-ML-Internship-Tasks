A collection of machine learning tasks and projects completed during my AI/ML Engineering Internship.

# Task 1: Exploring and Visualizing a Simple Dataset

## 🎯 Objective
Understand how to load, inspect, and visualize a dataset to explore data trends and distributions.

---

## 📊 Dataset
**Name:** Iris Dataset  
**Source:** Seaborn Library / CSV format  
**Description:**  
The Iris dataset contains 150 flower samples with 4 numerical features and 1 target class (`species`).

---

## ⚙️ Steps Performed
1. **Data Loading:** Loaded the dataset using pandas and seaborn.
2. **Inspection:** Viewed shape, columns, head, info, and descriptive statistics.
3. **Visualization:**  
   - Scatter plot to view feature relationships  
   - Histograms for feature distribution  
   - Box plots for outlier detection  
   - Pair plot for complete feature comparison
4. **Insights:** Summarized observed data patterns.

## 🧠 Key Insights
- No missing values found.
- Petal length and width show clear species separation.
- Sepal features overlap across species.
- Distributions are mostly symmetric with minimal outliers.

## 🧩 Libraries Used
- pandas  
- seaborn  
- matplotlib
